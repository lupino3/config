This repository contains the configuration files and scripts that I use in
machines that I have access to. Some are written by me and some are not.

The files written by me are:
- .vimrc (derived from an old vimrc.example)
- .screenrc (derived from an old Debian /etc/screenrc)
- .scripts/ip.sh
- a few parts of .bashrc

Use and modify them as you wish, I hereby put them in the public domain.
