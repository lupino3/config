This repository contains the configuration files and scripts that I use in
machines that I have access to. Some are written by me and some are not.

The files written by me are:
- .vimrc (derived from an old vimrc.example)
- .screenrc (derived from an old Debian /etc/screenrc)
- .scripts/ip.sh
- a few parts of .bashrc

Use and modify them as you wish, I hereby put them in the public domain.

Here is a list of included software that was not written by me, along with the
respective version and a link to the homepage:

- pyflakes.vim      3.01 (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2441)
- po.vim            1.2  (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=695)
- TabLaTeX          1.1  (http://www.cavecanen.org/latex/tablatex/)

Of course those are released under the license chosen by the original
developers. You should refer to the respective web sites to obtain info about
the licenses.
